Fig.1: Glioma sub-regions. Shown are image patches with the tumor sub-regions that are annotated in the different modalities (top left) and the final labels for the whole dataset (right). The image patches show from left to right: the whole tumor (yellow) visible in T2-FLAIR (Fig.A), the tumor core (red) visible in T2 (Fig.B), the enhancing tumor structures (light blue) visible in T1Gd, surrounding the cystic/necrotic components of the core (green) (Fig. C). The segmentations are combined to generate the final labels of the tumor sub-regions (Fig.D): edema (yellow), non-enhancing solid core (red), necrotic/cystic core (green), enhancing core (blue).
